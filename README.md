# Python Reddit Sentiment Analysis

This is a basic project that I completed for fun and to test my ability to learn AI.

The project will take a search term and generate the general sentiment of that search term in the r/politics sub-reddit, and graph it over time.

Reddit is not the most ideal source for information regarding politics, however, the project is more a proof of concept and could be expanded to include more reputable sources of information.
